# Name of my project: Book Attic

This is basically a online books ordering service. In my project I tried to show books for people for reading. 

## Feature in this site:
1. After entering in the app in the navbar there are  home, orders, admin, deals and log in.
2. You should first log into the app because without it you can't use the app.
3. Then you can choose books for buying. 
4. You can also see your previous ordered books.
5. Admin can add and remove books from database and home page.
